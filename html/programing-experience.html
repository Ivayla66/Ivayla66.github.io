      <h1>Programming Experience</h1>
      <p>
        My programming journey is still in its early stages. I first encountered programming during an online Python
        basics course last summer.
        It was my first introduction to writing code, and I enjoyed learning how to solve problems through programming.
        I was able to grasp basic concepts like loops, conditional statements, and functions, but I still need to work
        on applying these skills in larger projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the last two years of school in Bulgaria, I also had some exposure to HTML and CSS. Although the experience
        was limited, it helped me understand the
        basics of how websites are structured and styled. I worked on simple static websites, learning how to design
        layouts and format content,
        but I have much more to learn when it comes to creating dynamic and responsive websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since starting my IT studies, Iâ€™ve been excited to expand my knowledge of programming languages, tools, and
        frameworks.
        I look forward to tackling more complex challenges as I continue to improve my skills through hands-on projects.
