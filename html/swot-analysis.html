      <h1>Personal SWOT Analysis</h1>
      <p>
        As I reflect on my journey, it's essential to assess my strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT)
        to understand where I stand.
      </p>
      <h2>Strengths</h2>
      <p>
        One of my key strengths is my willingness to learn. Although I don't have a lot of experience in coding, I am
        always eager to tackle new challenges.
        I am also patient and persistent, which helps me when working through complex problems. Additionally, I am
        highly ambitious and set high standards for myself,
        which motivates me to continuously improve and achieve my goals.
      </p>

      <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
      <p>
        A key weakness is my limited experience in programming. Although I have completed an online Python basics course
        and have some exposure to HTML and CSS
        during my last two school years in Bulgaria, I still have a lot to learn. At times, I can also be overly
        ambitious, which makes it difficult to maintain a balance
        between perfectionism and progress.
      </p>

      <h2>Opportunities</h2>
      <p>
        The opportunities ahead of me are vast. Studying IT provides me with a platform to develop critical skills that
        are in high demand.
        As I continue my studies, I have access to resources, internships, and projects that can help me gain practical
        experience and build a strong portfolio.
        The growing tech industry offers numerous possibilities, and I plan to explore fields like software development,
        cybersecurity, or data science.
      </p>

      <h2>Threats</h2>
      <p>
        One of the potential threats is the fast pace of technological change, which means I need to stay updated with
        the latest trends and tools.
        Falling behind could be a risk if I donâ€™t actively keep learning. Another challenge is the competition in the
        tech industry, where many people
        are vying for the same opportunities. To stand out, I need to continually work on improving my skills and
        staying motivated.
